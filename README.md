# Neural Decoder Group Project

The aim of this group project was to design a causal neural decoder in MATLAB, designed to drive a hypothetical prosthetic device, which is a realistic and difficult task in brain-machine interfacing. Spike trains recorded from a monkey's brain were provide, as it repeatedly performs an arm movement task. The developed algorithm was able to estimate, from these data, the precise trajectory (X & Y position) of the monkey's hand at each moment in time as it reaches for the target. 

The developed MATLAB function accepts two arguments: a set of training data (that includes reaching angles and trajectory data), and a set of test data (which only has spike trains and are not included in the training data). The function then returns the appropriate angle classification and position estimation.

Three different classifiers were implemented for identifying reaching angle: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian. Majority voting was used to select the most likely direction, obtaining a final angle classification accuracy of 99.75%. Principal Component Regression (PCR) was used to estimate the x and y hand positions as a function of time obtaining a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 𝟕.𝟑𝟕±𝟎.𝟔𝟕 with the optimal number of principal components. Non-Linear Least Means Squares (N-LMS) algorithm was also implemented for x and y hand position estimation but was inferior to results obtained using PCR both in terms of RMSE and computational time.
